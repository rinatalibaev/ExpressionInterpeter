Mathematical Expression Interpreter

1. This interpreter is designed to evaluate mathematical expressions containing numeric constants, 
variables, parentheses, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. 
Extra spaces in the expression are ignored. **Unary minus is supported**.
2. Map keys must be Strings. Map values could be int or double. 
3. To run the interpreter, define the expression and variables in the bin/expression_interpreter.dart
file and execute `dart run`. 
4. To run tests execute `dart test`.
